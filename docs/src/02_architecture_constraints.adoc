== Architecture Constraints

In this section we will pinpoint the constraints that come into play for the design of our application and its architecture.

=== List of constraints

|===
| Constraint type | Constraint description | Repercussions

| Technical
| Using Git and GitHub for version control.
| Requires the team to get accustomed to GitHub and its functionalities. 

| Technical
| Deploying the application to access it through a web browser.

| Mandatory inclusion of LLM functionalities to help the user.
| Requires the team to get familiarized with the LLM selected (Qwen) and implement it into the program.

| Organizational
| There is a time limit established.
| The application must be developed in a few months, which sets a time limit for the team.

| Organizational
| Using pull requests for code submissions.
| Ensures that more than one person will be responsible of each commit.

| Organizational
| Holding regular team meetings.
| A team meeting must be held at least once a week (or more if required) and the participants and contents of said meeting must both be noted down.

| Developing an application with code up to standards.
| Code developed by the team must be as clear to understand as possible (i.e. following code conventions, or adding documentation), in order to ensure the maintainability of the application.

| Conventional
| Ensuring the LLM provides factual clues.
| Requires to adjust the LLM accordingly to ensure it does not provide any falsehoods that may confuse the player of the game.
