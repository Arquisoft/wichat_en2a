== Introduction and Goals

=== Introduction

We are a team of seven Software engineering *students* working for ChattySw, a company that has been hired by RTVE aiming to extend their online version of the "Saber y Ganar" quiz show.
We are starting from scratch, using a skeleton provided by the company to begin working on the desire web page.


=== Requirements Overview

The system is designed to provide an interactive quiz experience based on *Saber y Ganar*. The key requirements include:

- **Web-Based Interface**: The application will be accessible through a web frontend, displaying questions, answers, and a hint system.  
- **User Accounts & Progress Tracking**: User partticipation will be tracked by the application, allowing them to view leaderboards and varios statistics. 
- **Automated Question Generation**: Questions will be taken from wikidata, and answers will be dynamically generated by the LLM.
- **AI-Powered Hints**: An LLM-based hint system will assist users without revealing direct answers, mitigating incorrect information.  
- **Time-Limited Responses**: Players must answer within a given time frame.  
- **API Access**: The system will expose APIs to retrieve user data and question details.
