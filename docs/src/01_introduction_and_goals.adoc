== Introduction and Goals

=== Introduction

We are a team of seven Software engineering *students* working for ChattySw, a company that has been hired by RTVE aiming to extend their online version of the "Saber y Ganar" quiz show.
The application we are taking as a reference was originally developed by another team from HappySw. This is their repository, from which we will take ideas: ðŸ“‚ link:https://github.com/Arquisoft/wiq_en2b[HappySw repository].


=== Requirements Overview

The system is designed to provide an interactive quiz experience based on *Saber y Ganar*. The key requirements include:

- **Web-Based Interface**: The application will be accessible through a web frontend, displaying questions, answers, and a hint system.  
- **User Accounts & Progress Tracking**: Users will be able to register and view their participation history, including game statistics.  
- **Automated Question Generation**: Questions and answers will be taken from WikiData.  
- **AI-Powered Hints**: An LLM-based hint system will assist users without revealing direct answers, mitigating incorrect information.  
- **Time-Limited Responses**: Players must answer within a given time frame.  
- **API Access**: The system will expose APIs to retrieve user data and question details.

For a detailed breakdown of requirements, please refer to the following document: ðŸ“„ link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_4KBTx6hVuR90cUW4LoDHEH0E3NZJ3DInacCZjAuGXY/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.knuq2aw7zapd[Project Requirements Document].
