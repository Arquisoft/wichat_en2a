== Architecture Decisions

=== Using endpoints in gateway service
This will provide some importante benefits, for example:

- **Centralized Routing**: Manages and directs traffic to microservices, improving scalability (see the quality requirements part).
- **Enhanced Security**: Acts as a security layer for authentication and logging.
- **Simplified Client Access**: Provides a unified API endpoint, making client-side development easier.

Some downsides could be that if the gateway service fails, our whole app fails. And this will also make our app harder to mantain.

=== Using MongoDB
We considered other data base models to use in our project, including MySQL and PostgreSQL, after some thinking, we sttled with MongoDB for the following reasons: 

- **Scalability**: Easily handles large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Flexible Schema**: NoSQL structure allows rapid iteration without worrying about complex migrations.
- **High Performance**: Fast reads and writes, very important when working with a game.
