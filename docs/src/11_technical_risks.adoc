== Risks and Technical Debts
One of the main risks of our project is the use of innovative but potentially unstable technologies and approaches. Below, there is a list with the key risks and technical debts, comparing our current choices with alternative solutions.

|===
| Decision | Current approach | Pros of current approach | Cons of current approach | Alternative Approach
| **Software environment** | Node.js | Great performance and we work with something new | We haven't work with it until now, more experience with other languages| Java  
| **Database** | MongoDB | Flexible, great perfromance with node and easy to use | Flexibility can lead to problems, lack experience with no relational DB | PostgreSQL
| **Incorrect answers** | LLM | Innovated and flexible | performance, inconsitent, external service | Database, wikidata  
| **Deployment** | Oracle Virtual Machine | Full control; no use of local resources; easy scalable | Limited performance due to VM constraints; better performance requires paid plans | Other external service, local machine
