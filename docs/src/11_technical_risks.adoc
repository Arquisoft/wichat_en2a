| Decision | Current approach | Pros of current approach | Cons of current approach | Alternative Approach
| **Software environment** | Node.js | Great performance and we work with something new | We haven't work with it until now, more experience with other languages (java)| Java  
| **Database** | MongoDB | Flexible, great perfromance with node and easy to use | Flexibility can lead to problems, lack experience with no relational DB | PostgreSQL
| **Incorrect answers** | LLM | Innovated and flexible | performance, inconsitent, external service | Database, wikidata
